# BioinformaticsChallengeML
Submission for Bioinformatics Challenge by McKeon Laws

Purpose: This code was made to satisfy the requierments of challenge E+.  
Given that it is in MATLAB, which requires a few steps to download, I have added some complexity in the form of accepting multiple proteins. I hope that this will show I understand the coding content. I'm much more comfortable with MATLAB's syntax, which allowed me to do more than needed for project E. 
I have also added screen recordings of me running the code and the txt files used. This is to show that it works without the need to download MATLAB. However, that is still an option.  

Downloading MATLAB: follow the instructions outline in the pdf titled "MatLab-Installation-Instructions-WVU". Its rather quick, honestly. 

Input: This program will accept amino acid sequences in FASTA format text files. Meaning that a ">" must be denoted to indicated the name of the sequence, afterwhich the amino acid sequence as a single line is given. 

Output: This program will output hydropathy plots of each protein.
